## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-ml.git
cd diabetes-prediction-ml
```

### 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add the Trained Model

Make sure to place the file `diabetes_prediction_pipeline_V2.pkl` in the same directory as `Deployment_Code.py`.

### 4. Run the Web App

```bash
streamlit run Deployment_Code.py
```

## üß† Model Training & Evaluation

- Various classifiers were tested (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Best-performing model was chosen based on precision-recall, ROC-AUC, and accuracy
- SMOTE was used to handle class imbalance effectively
- Final model trained on full processed dataset and serialized using `joblib`
